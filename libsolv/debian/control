Description: dependency solver using a satisfiability algorithm (shared library)
 This dependency solver code in this package is based on two major, but
 independent, blocks:
 .
 1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
    and dependency information.
 2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
    resolving package dependencies.
 .
 Supported package formats:
   - rpm/rpm5
   - deb
   - Arch Linux
   - haiku
 .
 Supported repository formats:
