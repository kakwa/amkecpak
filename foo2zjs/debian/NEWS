foo2zjs (20090908dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this version all HP firmwares are looked for into
  /lib/firmware/hp/ instead of upstream /usr/share/foo2zjs/firmware/
  (thus solving bug #517957).

  The upstream /usr/bin/getweb and /lib/udev/hplj1000 scripts have
  been patched to use this new location.  foo2zjs postinst should
  automatically handle the migration of every firmware present in
  the old location to the new one.
